# Design
Because I didn't know how to write this code at the begginning, so I just imitated the source code [selpg.c](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cn/linux/shell/clutil/selpg.c), So I didn't use so many functions, which may let you see some awful. So some details of the code will be not described here.

- We can see the files in the project: 

> -the selpg.go is the source code.

> -the outputx.txt is the file to output the pages

> -the testx.txt is the "inputFile" I use

> -the errorx.txt is the stderr that may be printed
